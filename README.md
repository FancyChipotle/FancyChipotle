# Welcome and Hello

I'm a senior studying Computer Science at Montana State University and currently work as an Infrastructure and Reliability intern at [Workiva](https://www.workiva.com/). I also work on a food sustainability mobile application called [Freats](https://freats.co/) in my spare time.

## Experience and Interests
What I've done, and what I would like to do.

### Frameworks
Through school and work projects, [Code|24 hackathons](http://www.launchcats.org/code24), and development of Freats, I've gotten comfortable using frameworks like [Angular](https://angular.io/), [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/), and [Express](https://expressjs.com/). I would like to use [React](https://reactjs.org/) or [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) a bit, and I think I may have a good project in mind :thinking:

### Languages
My favorite languages at the moment are Go, Python, and Kotlin. Python's my go-to for quick little projects, scripts, or school assignments, but it seems to get a little messy (especially with dependencies) when used on bigger scale. I like Go partly because it's still pretty new but also because it's got some great speed, built-in concurrency, and strong typing. Both of the mobile apps I've built for university projects have been in Kotlin, and I've come to really appreciate the efficiency and conciseness it offers in place of Java's boiler plate code that often makes projects feel more bloated than necessary.

### Web (and Mobile) Development
If you hadn't already guessed by the frameworks I listed off, I'm most interested in web development at the moment. I don't have much experience or skill in creating a beautiful UI/UX for a website or mobile app, but I've learned much about the many moving parts of a full-fledged application, from databases to APIs. My work on Freats, the food sustainability app, has consisted mostly of work with the app's logic and the [Firbase database](https://firebase.google.com/) that serves the app.

## What of the Future?
I don't really know what the future holds, especially in times such as this, but as for myself and my journey as a programmer and computer scientist, I want to learn a lot about the different tech teams that make up a company, from DevOps to Infrastructure engineers to the ladies and gents on the front lines of UI/UX design. Freats is merely the beginning of what I hope to be many fun and useful side projects that satiate my hunger for knowledge and that help some people out along the way.
